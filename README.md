Single-Field Credit Card Input
=======

This is a jQuery-based, progressively-enhanced solution for creating a [single-field credit card input](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1667). The idea is to create a more streamlined credit card entry process.

The solution is based on the [fantastic work](http://zdfs.github.io/toscani/paymentInfo/index.html) by @zdfs and [awesome modification](https://github.com/bradfrost/single-field-cc) by @bradfrost
